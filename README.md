# Introduction to Machine Learning

# OpenLearningLibrary version of MIT 6.036

This course introduces principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction. It includes formulation of learning problems and concepts of representation, over-fitting, and generalization. These concepts are exercised in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, with applications to images and to temporal sequences.

Recommended prerequisites include: computer programming with Python, basic linear algebra including matrix manipulation, and multivariate calculus including gradients.

This course content derives from 6.036 taught during the Spring 2019 semester on campus at MIT.
